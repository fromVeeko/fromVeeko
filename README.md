Hi everybody!
I'm Nicola, currently student @ university of Udine (IT).
Hope you find something useful between my repos, but more probably you'll only find some stuff for my university projects. 
Or maybe I've already uploaded something interesting but I forgot to update this file

<!---
fromVeeko/fromVeeko is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
